# PrintBinaryTreeVerticalOrder
A Java implementation to display a binary tree in vertical order

Implemented a solution for the post Print a Binary Tree in Vertical Order
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-binary-tree-vertical-order/

I saw the title of the article on my phone and decided to implement a solution.
It seems that Geeks for Geeks has two separate articles (possible two additional implementations).

If you are interested in my approach you can read more about it the following post in my blog:

Hope you enjoy it.
